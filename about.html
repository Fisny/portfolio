                    Hi, I’m Fatbardh Fisniku, a <span id="aboutAge"></span>-year-old Software & Web Developer born in Albania and raised in Italy.<br />
                    I arrived in Italy in 2001, settling in Genoa, where I developed a passion for technology and coding.<br />
                    Since I was a kid, I’ve always been fascinated by technology.<br />
                    I remember having fun pretending to be a hacker with my friends, using CMD to change the text color from white to green, just like the movies.<br />
                    That simple curiosity sparked my interest in computing, and from there, my journey into the world of technology began.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Since 2021, I’ve been working as a .NET developer, specializing in technologies such as C#, Azure DevOps, Microsoft SQL, and more.<br />
                    My experience primarily revolves around the Microsoft tech stack, where I’ve gained hands-on expertise in creating, debugging, and optimizing applications.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    I have a particular interest in intranet environments, where I often work with Putty for SSH tunneling to access specific LDAP environments.<br />
                    Much of my work involves processing files like XML, JSON, and CSV, integrating them into SQL tables, and creating scheduled C# jobs to handle updates and duplicates.<br />
                    I’ve also worked with Oracle VM VirtualBox to connect virtual machines and monitor data flows.<br />
                    On the server-side, I’ve configured both test and production environments using IIS Manager, ensuring the smooth deployment of .dll and .exe files.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    In addition to backend development, I have a strong background in API creation and testing with Postman, as well as designing efficient database structures, implementing primary and foreign keys, and writing stored procedures and functions to optimize data handling.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I have a passion for enhancing the design and responsiveness of websites. I’ve worked on several projects for DHL, where I focused on creating user-friendly, visually appealing, and responsive sites.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Before transitioning into software development, I spent several years as a non-destructive testing technician, traveling throughout Italy and occasionally across Europe. This experience has helped me develop a strong sense of problem-solving and attention to detail, which I now apply to my development work.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4 class="textPers">Education</h4>
                <p>I hold a technical diploma in electrical maintenance and have completed two key coding courses to build my expertise:</p>
                <ul style="color: white;">
                    <li>A Boolean Careers course focused on Full Stack Development, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and the Laravel framework.</li>
                    <li>A C#-specific course at Experis Academy, specializing in ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework for web development.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <h4 class="textPers">Passion and Key Skills</h4>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I’m passionate about MMA, drawing, listening to music, and eating healthy. Professionally, I have a diverse skill set, including but not limited to:

                <p></p>
                <h4 class="textPers">Key Projects</h4>
                <p>Two of the most significant projects I’ve worked on are DHL MyCustomsDox and DHL MCDC. These projects were especially important to me because of the effort and collaboration that went into them. From the initial project skeleton to code-behind checks, JWT token generation, and the implementation of responsive design, the work was extensive. We also integrated barcode scanning using JavaScript libraries and ensured smooth communication between LDAP systems and SQL tables. It was an incredible experience working alongside talented developers and designers.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4 class="textPers">Motivation & Future Aspirations</h4>
                <p>I am a highly determined and focused individual, always committed to solving tasks and ensuring project deadlines are met. I take great pride in teamwork and the human aspect of collaboration, always willing to assist my colleagues in resolving challenges. As I continue to grow as a developer, I am driven to learn new technologies, tackle more complex problems, and expand my skill set in both backend and frontend development.</p>
